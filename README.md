# city-state-data

Grabs information about every city's latitude, longitude, and tax rate within the US and stores each state in its own CSV file. <br />
<br />

## Requirements
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* A [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment) in the root directory (recommended) 

## Running the application
This app uses different libraries, so in your virtual environment (or the root directory of this application), run this to install the necessary libraries:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

<br />

After that, run the script with

`python3 app.py`

and watch the magic unfold!
